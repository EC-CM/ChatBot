# AIML Chatbot

I created this simple chatbot as a smaller project alongside my Rubik's Cube solver in December 2023, looking to explore a top-down AI. It is coded in AIML, with a little C#.

It is a step up from basic template responses, as it can respond dynamically - remembering variables, randomising responses and allowing patterns to be matched in various forms with wildcards.

The below best shows its ability, as it is able to remember its place in a joke and respond appropriately.
